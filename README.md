This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Hey!

I'm Joel Colombo, a designer turned entrepreneur. My journey started as an independent designer and evolved into co-founding and leading a design agency. What really drives me is helping other founders bring their vision to life through design, technology & strategy.

After twenty years of restless work, I'm taking a sabbatical to reflect, recharge, and prepare for my next adventure. While still on a career break, Iâ€™m always open to meeting new people and exploring fresh ideas.
