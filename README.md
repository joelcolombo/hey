## Hey!

I'm Joel Colombo, a designer turned entrepreneur. My journey started as an independent designer and evolved into co-founding and leading a design agency. What really drives me is helping other founders bring their vision to life through design, technology & strategy.

After twenty years of restless work, I'm taking a sabbatical to reflect, recharge, and prepare for my next adventure. While still on a career break, Iâ€™m always open to meeting new people and exploring fresh ideas.
